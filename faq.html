				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is LION?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>LION is an abbreviation for LIpid ONtology; LION is an ontology database containing information related to lipid metabolism. An ontology is a way to formalize knowledge by using semantic triples: subject–predicate–object expressions (e.g. "Bobby - is - a cat", or "PC(16:0/16:0) - has a - C16:0 fatty acid").</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is LION/web?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>LION/web is a website that can be accessed via www.lipidontology.com. LION/web performs enrichment analyses on user-provided lipidomics datasets. The tool will report enrichment of LION-terms, which are sets of lipids that share a certain property. An example of a LION-term is 'sphingolipids', this term contains all lipid species in the dataset of the class 'sphingolipids'.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is a LION-term?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>LION contains nodes and relations and is hierarchically structured. Lipid species are placed in the bottom of the tree, whereas lipid properties are placed higher. As a result, all these properties are directly or indirectly linked with a subset of lipid-species. A LION-term is a node in the ontology containing all its lipid species associations. A LION-term has a name (for example, 'diacylglycerophosphocholines [GP0101]'), an ID (for example 'LION:0000030') and a list of associations (for example 'PC(16:0/18:1); PC(16:0/16:1; PC(36:2); etc...').</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why should I used LION/web?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Lipidomics profiling is getting more and more popular. Nevertheless, tools to analyze lipidomics data were largely lacking. A risk of analyzing large datasets manually, without the support of unbiased tools, is cherry picking. Even if you are aware of this risk, it is very hard to keep track of all trends and not to focus on your favourite lipid class or fatty acid. LION/web keeps an eye on the big trends for you. Moreover, there is no other tool yet that is able to combine the many dimensions (lipid classes, fatty acid saturation, association with biophysical properties, etc.) of lipidomics data in one analysis. Publication-quality figures and tables can be downloaded in just a few mouse clicks.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Does LION/web use Gene Ontology (GO)?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No. Although there are many similarites, LION/web is not using Gene Ontology (GO). LION/web performs enrichment analysis using a dedicated lipid-related ontology called LION. Nevertheless, the enrichment analysis algorithm (the <a href=http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html target="_blank">topGO</a> R-package) that is used by LION/web was initially built for GO-enrichment.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How should I format input files?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>There are three ways to submit data. In most cases, users will use the 'ranking mode' with CSV-file upload. Here, a 'comma-separated values' (CSV)-file can be uploaded to LION/web. This CSV-file is a flat text-file containing the lipidomics data and some metadata. LION/web expects the following format: first a column with the names of the lipid species; followed by columns containing numeric data that represent lipid conentrations. The first row of these columns should contain a condition identifier, the second row a unique sample identifiers. The minimum amount of samples per condition is two, the minimum amount of conditions is two. If you format the CSV-file in Excel, make sure the delimiter is set to 'comma' and the decimal separator is set to 'point'. The file should look like this:</p><br>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Should I normalize my data before submitting it to LION/web?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, this is very important. There are many ways to normalize data, so LION/web cannot check wether data is properly normalized. If you don't know how to normalize the data, we recommend normalization by expressing all lipid species as fraction of the sum. A popular website that supports several normalization algorithms is <a href=https://www.metaboanalyst.ca target="_blank">MetaboAnalyst</a>.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I have missing values in my dataset. Is this a problem?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, LION/web cannot process datasets with missing values and produce an error. Missing values can be caused by biological and/or technical reasons. Hence, there is not one simple solution. Typically, you can either romove lipids with missing values or replace missing values by an imputed value. Many approaches exist. A popular website that supports several algorithms to impute missing values is <a href=https://www.metaboanalyst.ca target="_blank">MetaboAnalyst</a>. More about imputation methods in lipidomics in this <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-19120-0 target="_blank">paper</a> and this <a href=https://metabolomics.cc.hawaii.edu/software/MetImp/ target="_blank">web-tool (MetImp)</a>. To use MetImp and MetaboAnalyst, CSV-files should be reformatted according to their formatting guidelines.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What lipid identifiers can I use?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Lipid nomenclature is not standardized in the lipidomics field. The best way to submit lipidomics data to LION/web is to make use of the notation style of LIPIDMAPS. In short, lipid species start with a class-prefix, followed by fatty acids that are surrounded by parentheses: (nr_of_C:nr_of_DBs/nr_of_C:nr_of_DBs). For example: PE(16:0/18:1), SM(d18:1/20:1), LPC(16:0). It's also possible to sum fatty acids: PC(36:2). Check <a href=https://www.lipidmaps.org target="_blank">www.lipidmaps.org</a> for more examples. A full list of currently supported lipid species can be found in the  <a href=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/07/398040.figures-only target="_blank">Supplemental Data 5</a> section from the LION/web pre-print. LION/web also support other often used notation styles, for instance notations without parentheses: PC 32:0. LION/web will try to convert this notation into LIPIDMAPS style. A list of conversion examples can be found in the pre-print's <a href=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/07/398040.figures-only target="_blank">Supplemental Data 6</a> section.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the enrichment analysis modes in LION/web?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>LION/web supports two different enrichment analysis modes: 'ranking mode' and the 'target-list mode'. The choice of the best mode depends on the type of data. For more information, check the representative sub-sections about these modes. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

                         <li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When should I choose 'target-list mode'?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The easiest way to get a feeling for enrichment analysis is by comparing a small subset of lipids ('target-list') with all the lipids in the experiment ('background-list'). This subset can be derived from many types of analysis. For instance, in a time-course experiment, it can happen that a subset of lipids behaves very similar: these lipids have a high level of correlation with each other. A question that migh rise is: do they share certain properties, like lipid class, or level of unsaturation? This question can be addressed in the 'target-list mode'. Simply enter the lipid names from the target-list in the upper panel and enter all lipid names in the experiment in the bottom panel. After submission, the fractions of all LION-terms will be assessed for both the target-list and the background list and compared. This is done by a one-tailed Fisher's exact test. This test will calculate the probability ('p-value') that the fractions of lipids associated with property X in both the target-list and the background-list are the same. In contrast, a low p-value will be returned when property X is more abundant in the target-list than in the background-list. For example, a target-list contains 20 lipids, of which 10 (= 50%) are fom the class phospatidylcholine. The background list contains 400 lipids and 50 (= 12.5%) of them are fom the class phospatidylcholine. This means that phospatidylcholines are 4x enriched (50 / 12.5 = 4) in the target-list. Indeed, a one-tailed Fisher's exact test return a p-value of 0.001785476: phospatidylcholines are (very) significantly enriched in the target-list.</p>

				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>    

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When should I choose 'ranking mode'</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Sometimes there is no obvious 'target-list' available. For instance, if you want to compare the lipidomes of condition B with condition A. Although it is possible to contruct a target-list (for example, by p-value or fold-change tresholding), the choice of an arbitrary treshold will affect the outcomes. To circumvent this, there is another enrichment analysis mode called 'ranking mode'. In this mode, lipids will be ranked based on a 'local statistic' (see next sub-section). To assess enrichment, the distribution of property X ('LION-term') will be analyzed. For example, in a lipidomics dataset with 400 lipids, 50 lipids are of the class phospatidylcholine. All lipids from this dataset are ranked by comparing (by 'local statistic') the concentrations of condition B vs. condition A. Lipids that are abundant in condition B are ranked higher, whereas abundant lipids in condition A are ranked lower. Now the distribution of phospatidylcholine will be analyzed. By chance, an uniform distribution of the 50 lipids is expected. However, when these lipids are found higher in the ranked list than one would expect by chance, phospatidylcholines are likely to be enriched in condition B. In LION/web, LION-term distributions will be assessed by one-tailed Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, resulting in probabilities ('p-values') that distributions are a result of chance. In contrast, low p-values will be returned when LION-terms are higher ranked than expected by chance: this term is enriched.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are local statistics and why do I need them?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>LION/web needs a value for every lipid to be able to rank them in the 'ranking mode', This value is called a 'local statistic'. In LION/web, you can choose from three different, build-in local statistics.</p>

					<p>LION/web supports three different local statistics.</p><br>
                                        <b>P-values from one-tailed Welch Two Sample t-tests. </b><p>Here, p-values are calculated for every lipid by comparing two conditions. The conditions of interest can be selected below. High ratios (A vs. B) will result in low p-values, so the ranking direction is from low to high. This setting is automatically updated after selecting this local statistic. T-tests are considered to be more robust as compared to fold change values.</p><br>
					<b>2-LOG[fold change] values. </b><p>For every lipid, the 2-LOG ratio of the mean concentrations of two conditions is calculated. Abundant lipids in condition B will result in positive values, whereas abundant lipids in condition A will result in negative values. Hence, the ranking direction is from high to low. This setting is automatically updated after selecting this local statistic. The conditions of interest can be selected below. This local statistic does not take standard deviation into account, so lipid concentrations close to noise levels can result in unexpected extreme 2-LOG[fold-change] values.</p><br>
					<b>P-values from one-way ANOVA F-tests. </b><p>With this local statistic, more than two conditions can be selected. For every lipid, a p-value from a one-way ANOVA F-test is calculated. Lipids with the highest fluctuations will result in the lowest p-values, so the ranking direction is from low to high. This setting is automatically updated after selecting this local statistic. </p>

					<p>By default, no user data will be shared with the LION-team. However, to improve the web-tool, we would be interested in the LION-coverage of those datasets. To help us to improve this, this options can be switched on. In that case, the names of lipids that can't be found in the LION-database is sent to the LION-team. With this information, we can specifically increase the coverage of lipid species that are found regularly but that are not present in LION yet. Note that only lipid species names ('identifiers') will be sent. Numeric data and enrichment results will NOT be shared.</p>

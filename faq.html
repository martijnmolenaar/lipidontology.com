				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>LION is an abbreviation for LIpid ONtology; LION is an ontology database containing information related to lipid metabolism. An ontology is a way to formalize knowledge by using semantic triples: subject–predicate–object expressions (e.g. "Bobby - is - a cat", or "PC(16:0/16:0) - has a - C16:0 fatty acid").</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is LION/web?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>LION/web is a website that can be accessed via www.lipidontology.com. LION/web performs enrichment analyses on user-provided lipidomics datasets. The tool will report enrichment of LION-terms, which are sets of lipids that share a certain property. An example of a LION-term is 'sphingolipids', this term contains all lipid species in the dataset of the class 'sphingolipids'.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Does LION/web use Gene Ontology (GO)?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No. Although there are many similarites, LION/web is not using Gene Ontology (GO). LION/web performs enrichment analysis using a dedicated lipid-related ontology called LION. Nevertheless, the enrichment analysis algorithm (the <a href=http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html target="_blank">topGO</a> R-package) that is used by LION/web was initially built for GO-enrichment.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How should I format input files?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>There are three ways to submit data. In most cases, users will use the 'ranking mode' with CSV-file upload. Here, a 'comma-separated values' (CSV)-file can be uploaded to LION/web. This CSV-file is a flat text-file containing the lipidomics data and some metadata. LION/web expects the following format: first a column with the names of the lipid species; followed by columns containing numeric data that represent lipid conentrations. The first row of these columns should contain a condition identifier, the second row a unique sample identifiers. The minimum amount of samples per condition is three, the minimum amount of conditions is two. If you format the CSV-file in Excel, make sure the delimiter is set to 'comma' and the decimal separator is set to 'point'. The file should look like this:</p><br>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Should I normalize my data before submitting it to LION/web?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, this is very important. There are many ways to normalize data, so LION/web cannot check wether data is properly normalized. If you don't know how to normalize the data, we recommend normalization by expressing all lipid species as fraction of the sum. A popular website that supports several normalization algorithms is <a href=https://www.metaboanalyst.ca target="_blank">MetaboAnalyst</a> .</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What lipid identifiers can I use?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Lipid nomenclature is not standardized in the lipidomics field. The best way to submit lipidomics data to LION/web is to make use of the notation style of LIPIDMAPS. In short, lipid species start with a class-prefix, followed by fatty acids that are surrounded by parentheses: (nr_of_C:nr_of_DBs/nr_of_C:nr_of_DBs). For example: PE(16:0/18:1), SM(d18:1/20:1), LPC(16:0). It's also possible to sum fatty acids: PC(36:2). Check <a href=https://www.lipidmaps.org target="_blank">www.lipidmaps.org</a> for more examples. A full list of currently supported lipid species can be found in the  <a href=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/07/398040.figures-only target="_blank">Supplemental Data 5</a> section from the LION/web pre-print. LION/web also support other often used notation styles, for instance notations without parentheses: PC 32:0. LION/web will try to convert this notation into LIPIDMAPS style. A list of conversion examples can be found in the pre-print's <a href=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/07/398040.figures-only target="_blank">Supplemental Data 6</a> section.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the enrichment analysis modes in LION/web?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>LION/web supports two different enrichment analysis modes: 'ranking mode' and the 'target-list mode'. The choice of the best mode depends on the type of data. For more information, check the representative sub-sections about these modes. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

                         <li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When should I choose 'target-list mode'?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The easiest way to get a feeling for enrichment analysis is by comparing a small subset of lipids ('target-list') with all the lipids in the experiment ('background-list'). This subset can be derived from many types of analysis. For instance, in a time-course experiment, it can happen that a subset of lipids behaves very similar: these lipids have a high level of correlation with each other. A question that migh rise is: do they share certain properties, like lipid class, or level of unsaturation? This question can be addressed in the 'target-list mode'. Simply enter the lipid names from the target-list in the upper panel and enter all lipid names in the experiment in the bottom panel. After submission, the fractions of all LION-terms will be assessed for both the target-list and the background list and compared. This is done by a one-tailed Fisher's exact test. This test will calculate the probability ('p-value') that the fractions of lipids associated with property X in both the target-list and the background-list are the same. In contrast, a low p-value will be returned when property X is more abundant in the target-list than in the background-list. For example, a target-list contains 20 lipids, of which 10 (= 50%) are fom the class phospatidylcholine. The background list contains 400 lipids and 50 (= 12.5%) of them are fom the class phospatidylcholine. This means that phospatidylcholines are 4x enriched (50 / 12.5 = 4) in the target-list. Indeed, a one-tailed Fisher's exact test return a p-value of 0.001785476: phospatidylcholines are (very) significantly enriched in the target-list.</p>

					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Should I select 'exclude parent terms with same associations as child'?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>LION has a hierarchical structure. This means that LION-terms are subdivided into more specific LION-terms. However, sometimes 'child' terms contain the same lipid species as their parents. In this case, assessing enrichment of both terms will result in the same enrichment scores, without providing useful information. Switching on this option will skip the parent term, resulting in increased statistical power.</p>

Note that LION has a hierarchical structure, sub-branches can be displayed by clicking on the symbol left of the names. Only (green) selected LION-terms will used in the analysis. An important benefit of LION-term pre-selection is the decreased amount of LION-terms, resulting in increased statistical power.</p>
